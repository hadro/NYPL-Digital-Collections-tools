# NYPL Digital Collections Tools

A set of python and bash scripts that do useful things for NYPL Digital Collections materials, such as:
- Create a PDF from a UUID (`createPDF.py`)
- Download a bunch of images (`id2u.py`, `id2pdf.py`, `id2jp2.py`,)

Generally, you'll need: 
- Python
- ImageMagick
- PDFtk

You'll also need to create a `config.py` file that contains your API key for the Digital Collections API.
